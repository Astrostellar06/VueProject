            <h3>Welcome to our project</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This project is a CO2 emission calculator. It allows you to calculate the CO2 emissions of your flights, your cloud computing activities and your car trips.</p>
            <p>It also allows you to compare the CO2 emissions of France and England from different sources.</p>
            <p>Our project is based on the Climatiq API.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>This project was made by a team of 2 students from <a href="https://www.efrei.fr/">EFREI Paris</a> during the year 2023-2024: Esteban Finance-Madureira & Cl√©ment Laubertie</p>
